# Currency-Converter

This currency converter utilises the VAT Comply API, which can be found at https://www.vatcomply.com/documentation

I made this project in order to improve my knowledge on how to utilise APIs in Python, and how to extract information from the APIs as well as how to use the information in the code.

# How To Use

This project can be used by running the main.py file found in the repository. By running, the file will as for the currency that the user would like to convert from, the currency to be converted to, as well as the amount of from-currency that the user would like to be converted. 
After running, the file will output the amount of from-currency, and the amount of converted currency.

This program can be used in other applications, where a currency converter is needed to help with different types of transactions or even just as an information tool.
